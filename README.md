**Construct 2 Templates**
======


All of these templates are free and available to use for anyone interested in making games in Construct 2.  The idea here is to take one of these templates, tweek and customize some of the details to then be able to create a game quickly.  Why rewrite logic for a game when someone has already done it, right?  That's the point.  I encourage and challenge you to leverage what I or others have already worked on so that the process will be that much easier you.  Why reinvent the wheel?
